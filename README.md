# Scratch-Project-Game
This project was made using the programming language Scratch. The goal of the game is to score points using the keyboard arrows (up, down, left and right) to catch the flying bread.

In order to create this project, I used: 
- two sprites
- one conditional
- one loop
- one variable
- a custom block with one input
